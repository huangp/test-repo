"After installing the operating system on each node for the architecture that "

"All nodes require Internet access for administrative purposes such as "
"package installation, security updates, <glossterm>DNS</glossterm>, and "
"<glossterm baseform=\"Network Time Protocol (NTP)\">NTP</glossterm>. In most "
"cases, nodes should obtain Internet access through the management network "
"interface. To highlight the importance of network separation, the example "
"architectures use <link xlink:href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/"
"rfc1918\">private address space</link> for the management network and assume "
"that network infrastructure provides Internet access via <glossterm baseform="
"\"Network Address Translation (NAT)\">NAT</glossterm>. To illustrate the "
"flexibility of <glossterm>IaaS</glossterm>, the example architectures use "
"public IP address space for the external network and assume that network "
"infrastructure provides direct Internet access to instances in your "
"OpenStack environment. In environments with only one block of public IP "
"address space, both the management and external networks must ultimately "
"obtain Internet access using it. For simplicity, the diagrams in this guide "
"only show Internet access for OpenStack services."
